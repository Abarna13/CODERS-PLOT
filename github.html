<p style="font-size: 20px;color:black;font-family: arial">GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project</p><br>

<p style="font-size: 30px;color: red; font-family: verdana"><b>FEATURES OF GITHUB</b></p><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color:black;font-family: arial"> GitHub offers the following features:<br>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration</li><br>
<li>Integrated issue and bug tracking</li><br>
<li>Graphical representation of branches</li><br>
<li>Approximately 6 million hosted git repositories</li><br>
<li>Code review</li><br>
<li>Project management</li><br>
<li>Team management</li><br>
<li>Social coding</li><br></p>
</ul></p>

<p style="font-size: 30px;color: red; font-family: verdana"> <b> USE OF GITHUB</b></p><br>

 <p style="font-size: 20px;color:black;font-family: arial"> Github is a web-based platform used for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.</p>

<p style="font-size: 30px;color: red; font-family: verdana"> <b> IS GIT AND GITHUB SAME</b></p><br>

	<p style="font-size: 20px;color:black;font-family: arial">>>what's the difference? Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.</p>

<p style="font-size: 30px;color: red; font-family: verdana"> <b> GITHUB IMPORTANCE</b></p><br>


<p style="font-size: 20px;color:black;font-family: arial" >GitHub is a centralized platform. Centralized for developers all around the globe. A person can just host the repository created in Git to the whole world.  Using this, it increases the chances of better project development and in less time. GitHub provides you with the easiness of combining the changes and removes the headache of sharing the large code files. If GitHub is not there, you will face a series of challenges in order to work together as a team.

First of all, the code needs to be shared among your teammates. A code file on a big project is heavy and will take a lot of resources. After the upload, when your teammates will make the changes to the file, they still have to upload the complete file each and every time. This problem is not present when you use GitHub. Just make the changes and push only the changes to the main code file. It will be fast and easy. As a project owner, you can track these changes quite easily on it.
